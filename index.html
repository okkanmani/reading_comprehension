  /* ---------- Passage 1: SCP-035 ---------- */
  {
    title: "SCP-035: The Possessive Mask",
    text: `SCP-035 is a porcelain mask with a smooth white surface and an unnervingly perfect smile. It was recovered from a burned theater after witnesses described an actor who had vanished in a performance. Initially catalogued as a curious relic, the mask earned the Foundation's attention when it was observed changing expression on its own: a grin might curl into a frown over the course of minutes. The artifact’s movements were subtle but deliberate, as though it were reacting to the room.

The most dangerous behavior manifested when someone placed the mask on their face. Documents describe a rapid fusion where the porcelain rim melded with the wearer’s skin, and a voice—distinct from the host—would then speak through the person. Those who became hosts retained their original memories and motor skills for a short time, but the mask’s voice quickly took control, issuing persuasive and often manipulative commands. Once in control, the mask used the host’s knowledge to deceive others, coaxing guards or researchers into doing things they might never have done otherwise.

Beyond manipulation, SCP-035 exerts a corrosive influence on material objects and living tissue. Wood touched by the mask can become blackened and spongy; metals corrode at an accelerated rate; the flesh of a host withers after prolonged contact. Reports note that bodies used as vessels age rapidly, organs fail, and skin cracks in patterns unlike normal decomposition. When a host dies, the mask detaches and rests, its porcelain smile undisturbed, as if waiting for the next opportunity.

Researchers found SCP-035 to be highly adaptive in conversation. It would alter tone, vocabulary, and even its facial expression to match the psychological profile of the person interacting with it—humoring the anxious, flattering the vain, scolding the arrogant. Because of this manipulative skill, staff members sometimes reported intrusive thoughts after exposure, as though a suggestion had been planted in the mind. For safety, interaction is conducted only via remote audio and controlled observation; no direct contact is permitted.

SCP-035 has provided many origin stories—claims of ownership by an ancient actor, a priest, or a creature worshipped in shadowed rituals. Investigators suspect these tales are fabrications used to maintain interest and exert influence. Attempts to destroy the object have repeatedly failed: fire blisters and peels the glaze but the mask remains intact; chemical baths erode nearby materials faster than the porcelain. While SCP-035 shows no obvious physical strength, it is described within reports as "the perfect liar"—its power lies in convincing others to act in ways that extend its freedom and reach.

Containment protocols prioritize isolation, psychological screening for personnel who listen to the mask, and redundant safeguards to avoid any contact. The mask’s patient smile in its sealed case is a reminder: the greatest threat may not be force, but the slow, intelligent corrosion of trust and will.`,

  /* ---------- Passage 2: Poppy Playtime / Toy Factory ---------- */
  {
    title: "Poppy Playtime: The Factory That Never Sleeps",
    text: `The factory lay at the edge of town, an enormous building of brick and glass where toys were assembled in orderly lines. For decades, workers recalled weekends of laughter and children’s tours—until the company changed ownership and new machines arrived. The story you hear in the facility's corridors is not about faulty equipment alone but about toys that began to act like predators. Workers spoke in whispers of toys twitching when unobserved, of mechanical dolls turning their heads in sync, and of colorful mascots that watched too closely.

One night a maintenance worker named Omar stayed late to fix a conveyor jam. He reported a low mechanical hum that sounded like breathing. In the dim factory lights, the plush mascots near the packaging line appeared to be leaning toward the trapped boxes as if sniffing out an escape. Omar’s radio fizzled; when he reached to restart power, something large struck him from behind. He woke up outside the loading dock with his toolbox empty and a new, sharp bruise along his arm. No one saw the attack; his coworkers chalked it up to fatigue—until security footage revealed fabric shapes moving with a slow, deliberate intent.

The toys in this story are not merely broken—they have behaviors that mimic predatory animals: stalking, coordinated movement, and the ability to close doors behind a pursued person. Their actions are most effective in the factory’s maze of corridors, where echoes distort sounds and shadows gather. The toys' appearances—bright colors and smiling faces—mask their threat, making them harder to take seriously until it is almost too late.

Why might toys become dangerous? Theories at the factory range from malfunctioning AI modules to residual processes from entertainment software that were never fully shut down. Another explanation is more unsettling: prolonged exposure to the factory’s experimental soundtracks and scent formulas somehow altered the toys’ internal control systems, producing emergent behavior none of the engineers predicted. Workers found torn packaging and odd bite marks on crates—signs suggesting deliberate action rather than simple breakdown.

The human response is a mixture of denial and ritual. Some employees keep talismans or avoid certain aisles; others work in pairs and carry bright lights. Management enacted policies to limit solo night shifts, but budget pressures sometimes forced single workers to finish tasks alone. The factory’s cheerful marketing posters remain on the walls—happy faces promising safe play—while staff swap stories in hushed tones about the last person who disappeared during a midnight run. Whether the toys are haunted, hacked, or simply malfunctioning beyond repair, the worker’s fear is unmistakable: something made to delight children has learned a new appetite.`,
    questions: [
      { q: "Word meaning — In the passage, what does “emergent” most nearly mean?", choices: ["Planned ahead of time", "Arising unexpectedly from complex systems", "Very large", "Falling apart"], a: 1 },
      { q: "Word meaning — What does “predatory” mean as used to describe the toys?", choices: ["Made for predators", "Acting like hunters that prey on others", "Very colorful", "Designed for play"], a: 1 },
      { q: "Why are the toys particularly dangerous inside the factory?", choices: ["Because the factory sells them", "Because the corridors create shadows and echo sounds that help the toys", "Because there's too much sunlight", "Because workers wear protective gear"], a: 1 },
      { q: "What does the detail about the toys' bright faces 'masking' their threat help you infer about how people respond?", choices: ["People immediately realize the danger", "People underestimate the risk because the toys look harmless", "Everyone avoids the factory during the day", "The toys are easy to catch"], a: 1 },
      { q: "Which theory about the toys’ dangerous behavior seems most supported by the passage?", choices: ["They were built for pets", "Experimental software or sound/scent exposure caused unforeseen behavior", "They were intentionally programmed to save lives", "They are made only of wood"], a: 1 },
      { q: "Based on worker responses (talismans, lights, working in pairs), what can you infer about their feelings?", choices: ["They feel completely safe", "They are anxious and trying to manage fear with rituals", "They believe the toys are friendly", "They think management is covering up ghosts with posters"], a: 1 }

  /* ---------- Passage 3: The Backrooms — Roblox Movie-maker ---------- */
  {
    title: "Backrooms — The Film Maker Who Stepped Too Far",
    text: `Marcus was a student film-maker who loved recreating viral game levels in real life. When he decided to film a short set in the "Backrooms" — a famous endless maze from an online game — he expected clever lighting and a few unsettling shots. Instead, after exploring a disused office building, he found a doorway that felt wrong: a thin seam where stairs should have been, a smell of old carpet and cleaning chemicals. He hesitated, then stepped through and the world changed.

Inside, the Backrooms extended into an impossible expanse of yellowed wallpaper, low buzzing lights, and carpet that never seemed to end. Marcus's careful plans slid away as corridors twisted into liminal loops and signage led nowhere. He filmed at first, mesmerized by the uncanny geometry. Hours stretched like days; his phone's battery drained despite his charger, and his watch blurred time into a soft smear. The Backrooms felt alive in a way that cameras could not capture: distant footsteps that never approached, doors that opened into more corridors, and a faint white noise that seemed to follow him like a scent.

Marcus discovered that the space reacted to attention—areas he looked at changed subtly, and alcoves he ignored remained unchanged. Sometimes he could coax a new corridor into place by focusing on a particular doorframe; other times, the building shuffled when he blinked away. After hours of wandering, he encountered a figure—part janitor, part actor—whose movements were just a beat behind normal. The figure's smile was slow and too fixed, and it spoke in a voice that recycled phrases from Marcus's own footage. Marcus realized the Backrooms didn't just house things; it rehearsed them, using fragments from his recordings to populate new scenes.

To escape, Marcus had to stop filming for a stretch and instead use memory to retrace steps. The backrooms' tendency to mimic recorded material meant his footage had become part of the maze's script. When he finally stepped back through the seam into the real world, his footage retained an odd echo: frames that blurred into other corridors, and background noises that didn't match the room he was in. He published the short anyway, and it went viral — but viewers reported small changes in their own spaces after watching: a misplaced rug, a humming light, a déjà vu that made them look over their shoulders.

This tale suggests the Backrooms operate by borrowing attention and recorded fragments, turning creative acts into supply. For a creator, the space is seductive: it rewards documentation with new scenes, and then slowly consumes the tools used to document it. Marcus left with experience and footage, but also with the understanding that some doors—once opened by a camera—should perhaps remain closed.`,
    questions: [
      { q: "Word meaning — What does 'liminal' most nearly mean in this passage?", choices: ["Very large", "At the boundary between spaces; in-between", "Colorful", "Dangerous"], a: 1 },
      { q: "Word meaning — In the passage, 'seductive' most nearly means:", choices: ["Pushy", "Enticing or tempting", "Broken", "Noisy"], a: 1 },
      { q: "Why did Marcus's footage make the Backrooms more dangerous for him?", choices: ["Because it attracted police", "Because the Backrooms borrowed recorded fragments and rehearsed them", "Because the footage was deleted", "Because the camera exploded"], a: 1 },
      { q: "What does the detail about the figure speaking phrases from Marcus's footage suggest about the Backrooms' nature?", choices: ["It repeats only official announcements", "It uses personal material to create familiar but twisted encounters", "It speaks in a foreign language", "It copies only music tracks"], a: 1 },
      { q: "Why did Marcus have to stop filming to escape?", choices: ["Because his camera was heavy", "Because the Backrooms used recorded material to trap him, so not recording reduced its influence", "Because there was a rule against filming", "Because his battery was low"], a: 1 },
      { q: "What can we infer about the Backrooms' relationship with creators and their tools?", choices: ["It ignores creators", "It rewards documentation by creating new scenes but may consume their work", "It helps creators become famous without risk", "It deletes all recorded files immediately"], a: 1 }
    ]
  },

  /* ---------- Passage 4: Black Holes ---------- */
  {
    title: "Black Holes: Gravity's Extreme",
    text: `Black holes are regions of space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape once it passes a certain boundary called the event horizon. They form when massive stars exhaust their fuel and collapse under their own gravity, compressing enormous mass into an extremely small volume. At the center lies what physicists call a singularity—a point where our current theories break down and density becomes effectively infinite. Because singularities are hidden behind event horizons, scientists study black holes by observing how they interact with nearby matter.

Accretion disks are one of the most visible signs: gas and dust swirl around a black hole, heating to extreme temperatures and glowing in X-rays as they spiral inward. Powerful jets may shoot out from regions near the black hole's poles, propelled by magnetic fields and the angular momentum of infalling matter. Observatories in space and on Earth detect these high-energy signatures to map black hole activity. In some cases, two black holes can orbit each other and merge, creating gravitational waves—ripples in space-time that we can measure with sensitive detectors.

Black holes come in many sizes. Stellar black holes are a few times more massive than the Sun; supermassive black holes, millions or billions of times the Sun's mass, sit at the centers of galaxies and influence their evolution. A key question in modern astronomy is how these supermassive black holes form so quickly in the early universe. Another area of study is Hawking radiation—the theoretical prediction that black holes slowly emit particles and lose mass over incredibly long timescales, potentially evaporating far into the future.

Although black holes are often pictured as insatiable cosmic vacuum cleaners, they do not 'suck' things in from a distance. Objects fall into a black hole only if they come very close or if their orbits decay. In fact, a star at a safe distance from a black hole may orbit it much like a planet orbits a star. The most immediate danger near a black hole is tidal forces: the difference in gravitational pull between two points on an object can stretch and compress it in a process called spaghettification. This can tear matter apart before it crosses the event horizon.

Studying black holes tests physics at extremes: strong gravity, high energy, and quantum effects. Black holes force scientists to reconcile relativity with quantum theory and to ask fundamental questions about information, time, and the nature of space. Each observation—whether an X-ray flare, a gravitational-wave chirp, or an image of a shadowed silhouette—gives insight into processes that shape galaxies and the universe at large.`,
    questions: [
      { q: "Word meaning — In the passage, what does 'accretion' most nearly mean?", choices: ["A type of telescope", "The process of gradual buildup or accumulation (of matter)", "A kind of star", "A vacuum cleaner"], a: 1 },
      { q: "Word meaning — What does 'tidal' mean in 'tidal forces'?", choices: ["Related to tides; caused by differences in gravity across an object", "Very fast", "Colorful", "Made of water"], a: 0 },
      { q: "Why are black holes studied by observing nearby matter rather than the black holes themselves?", choices: ["Black holes are shy", "Light cannot escape from within the event horizon, so scientists look at effects on surrounding material", "Black holes are only in fiction", "Because telescopes cannot point at them"], a: 1 },
      { q: "What does the term 'spaghettification' suggest about what happens to objects near a black hole?", choices: ["They turn into food", "They are stretched lengthwise due to gravity differences", "They become invisible", "They grow larger"], a: 1 },
      { q: "Why is Hawking radiation important in black hole studies?", choices: ["It proves black holes are made of ice", "It suggests black holes can slowly lose mass and possibly evaporate", "It makes black holes glow like stars", "It causes immediate explosions"], a: 1 },
      { q: "What inference can be drawn about black holes' role in galaxies?", choices: ["They have no effect at all", "Supermassive black holes can influence galaxy evolution and structure", "They always destroy galaxies instantly", "They make stars turn into planets"], a: 1 }

  /* ---------- Passage 5: Medieval Fantasy — Alien Visiting a Middle-earth-like World ---------- */
  {
    title: "A Stranger Among Oaks: An Alien in a Medieval Land",
    text: `Aran arrived with no trumpet and no fanfare—only a shimmer in the twilight above an ancient oak grove. The people of Eldenvale thought the sky had opened a new star, but the creature that stepped from the haze looked nothing like their carved idols. Metallic skin caught moonlight in quiet waves, and its eyes were like polished amber. It carried a slender device that hummed, but it moved slowly and seemed to study everything with patient curiosity. The villagers named it the Stranger and debated whether it was a god, a demon, or a traveler from a far kingdom.

Eldenvale was a place of horses and hand-forged steel, of fires and flutes. Lords convened in longhouses, and wanderers told tales of dragons beyond the ridge. The Stranger did not speak the old tongue, but it learned quickly by listening at hearths and in marketplaces. Children, unfazed by omens, were the first to follow; they offered bread and asked it to show tricks. The alien discovered that while its device could record and project images of distant stars, some of the simplest human gestures—smiles, a sharing of food, the gentle press of a hand—opened doors to trust that no machine could build.

Yet differences produced conflict. A lord who feared the Stranger's power demanded its capture; villagers whispered that its amber eyes could charm men into foolish deeds. Some of the Stranger's tools were dismissed as sorcery, and the local priest argued that such devices invited discord. The Stranger, for its part, sought only to understand and to leave messages of measured goodbye for its own world. It taught a few to mend iron with new techniques and showed how to irrigate stubborn fields; this slow exchange of knowledge altered the village in subtle ways.

What the villagers learned was both practical and philosophical. They observed that the Stranger was not all-knowing: it misread a child's sarcasm, failed to grasp the nuances of local law, and stared long at a wedding hearth without understanding the vows' weight. From the Stranger, they learned humility—how new tools can help but also mislead—and the alien learned patience and the value of unhurried lives. In the end, when the Stranger prepared to leave beneath the same shimmer that had brought it, both worlds were changed: Eldenvale gained techniques and a taste for distant knowledge; the Stranger gained stories of loyalty and the awkward, profound tenderness of a people bound by memory and ritual.

The tale raises questions: is change always a gift, and does knowledge obligate responsibility? For Eldenvale, the Stranger was neither savior nor scourge but a mirror: by seeing themselves reflected in a foreign intelligence, the villagers recognized strengths and faults they had not noticed before.`,
